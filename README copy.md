# My Website

This is just the source for my personal website. Probably not a great deal of super interesting stuff to see here, as it's effectively just a fancier version of my resume.

Yes, I do acknowledge that it's overkill to use React & TypeScript to build a very simple, static website like this, but hey, I'm a software engineer--overkill is what I do.

If you want to see it live, you can view in all of its glory at [https://gargrave.dev](https://gargrave.dev). Like I said, I am not a designer by any means, so I keep it pretty simple.
